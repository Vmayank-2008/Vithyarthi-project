BMI Calculator – Simple Explanation

1. What is BMI?

BMI means Body Mass Index. It is a number that tells if your weight is healthy for your height. It helps to know if a person is:

1.Underweight

2.Normal

3.Overweight

4.Obese


It is just a basic guide to understand body weight.

2. How the BMI Calculator Works

This BMI calculator is made using Python and Tkinter (a tool to create windows and buttons).

The user enters:

1.Height in centimeters (cm)

2.Weight in kilograms (kg)


Then the program calculates BMI and shows the result with the weight category.

3. What You need to give input

1.Height(in cm)
2.Weight(in Kg)

Both values must be greater than zero and must be numbers.

4. Calculate Button

When you click Calculate BMI:

The program takes your height and weight

Converts height from cm to meters

Uses this formula:


BMI = Weight ÷ (Height × Height)

Then it shows your BMI result

5. Result Shown

The result will look like this: BMI: 22.45 - Normal

BMI Categories:

Less than 18.5 → Underweight

18.5 to 24.9 → Normal

25 to 29.9 → Overweight

30 or more → Obese

6. Error Handling

If you:

Leave boxes empty

Type letters instead of numbers

Enter zero or negative values


The program will show a message asking you to enter correct values.
